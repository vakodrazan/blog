                    This village is still a rural village but well-known to everyone. 
                    It is surrounded by green spaces including pine forests. 
                    If people have never been there, it is easy for them to know that Soalazaina 
                    is near when they got into a pine forest. Saturday is the market day in there. 
                    I can say that 80 per cent of the population are farmers.

                    There is a company called Bdf in there. It is a Chinese company. 
                    It is so popular in Ambatondrazaka district. Lots of people come to visit that company. 
                    They went there to search a job. Even people far from the village came there to visit it. 
                    They are inquisitive about it.
