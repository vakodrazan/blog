          There were a heavy rain during whole Suturday. 
          When we came home, we were amazed. 
          There was a flood in the place where we live. 
          All of the things inside the house were wet. 
          I have never faced a situation like this in my whole life. 
          However, it didn't come to the house where I stay.

        <p>
          We were decided to go to church the Sunday morning. 
          In the early morning, we went out to check for the way if it is ok. 
          Unfortunately, the road was full of water. There was no chance to go. 
          It was too deep. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We delved into an idea to go for a walk to spend our day. 
          We decided to visit<em>the bridge</em> which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahanoro">Mahanoro</a>. 
          It is such a cool place for hanging out with friends.

          Visiting Mahanoro bridge

        <p>
          We went for a walk to spend our day even though it was a bit rainy . 
          When we came there we were impressed  by what was happenning. 
          There were lots of people in there. People said that there were boats that have
          lost in the sea. However, they had tried to take it back, but then some of them was already far. 
          They couldn't take it back anymore because the sea was too strong.
          The boats that was lost were from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_des_Pangalanes">Pangalanes riviere</a>. The flood broke up many things such as houses. Lots of houses were broken down because of the flood. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That was happenning here in Mahanoro during the week of <time datetime="2020-02-15">15 of february, 2020</time>. 
          It is such an unforgetable story because it is my 1<sup>st</sup> time that I faced thing like this in my whole life.
