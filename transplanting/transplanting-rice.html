            <h2>
                Time of transplanting
            </h2>
            <img src="transplenting.jpg" alt="before transplanting">
            <p>
                People usually deracinate the rice before planting it in the where it should be. 
                They lived it for about <b>two days</b> at least in a good place then it won't dry.
            </p>
            <h2>Transplanting rice</h2>
            <img src="transplenting-rice.jpg" alt="Transplanting rice">
            <p>
                After two days or about we can transplant the rice then it will grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it needs some products like <b>manure</b> to make it better.
            </p>
            <h2>Needs for farming</h2>
            <img src="zebu.jpg" alt>
            <p>
                We need <b>zebus</b> to work in the rice field 
                even before transplanting or during the harvest time. 
                They are really useful animals.
            <p> We also can use another materiel 
                but zebu is the most useful here in Madagascar, 
                we also can have manure from them and use it for our farming.
            </p>
            <p>
                However we need to take care of them 
                like put them in a <b>good place</b>, feed them 
                some vegetation after working and give some water.

                The majority, it is month of <b>May</b> and <b>June</b> 
                are the time of harvesting rice here in Madagasar. 
                Some of the people harvested rice during the <b>winter</b> time but that is not really common.

                    Nowadays, people use keet the <b>rice with its stem</b> 
                    as we can see in the picture for about a week or so 
                    it depends on the owner even though they leave it 
                    in the rice field for about a month it won't go off.
                </p>
                <p>People did that because they have a <b>huge rice field</b> 
                    then they can't do all the work on one day.

                Most of the time people usually eat or keep their first 
                product but they don't seel it because that is <b>the Malagasy
                culture</b> "people believed that if you sell your first product before everything, 
                it will be hard to find any crops for the next year."
