                    When I delve into Malagasy life. I become an inquisitive about letting you to know about that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, almost <b>seventy percent</b> (70%) of residence 
                    in <b>Madagascar</b> are <var>farmers</var>. Including Alaotra Mangoro region is one of 
                    the most popular of farming rice because there always has a good product every year.

                <h2>
                    Time of transplanting
                </h2>
                <img src="transplenting.jpg" alt="before transplanting">
                <p>
                    People usually take a rice seedling from the first place they plant it before transplanting it in a place where it should be. 
                    They leave it for about <em>two days</em> at least in a good place that is not hot but not really cold too.
                </p>
                <h2>Transplanting rice</h2>
                <img src="transplenting-rice.jpg" alt="Transplanting rice">
                <p>
                    After two days or about we can transplant the rice. After transplanting, 
                    they usually make the rice field dry at least two days to make it rapidly growing up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is good to use some products like <strong>manure</strong> if the rice field is not fertile.
                </p>
                <h2>Needs for farming</h2>
                <img src="zebu.jpg" alt>
                <p>
                    We need <b>zebus</b> to work in the rice field 
                    even before transplanting or during the harvesting. 
                    They are such a useful animals. Also, we can have manure for our farm from zebu.
                <p>
                    Even though, there are different types of materiel that we can use but Malagasy people prefer to use zebu, 
                    because it is easy to use and don't spend lots of money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we need to take care of them 
                    like put them in a <b>good place</b>, feed them 
                    some vegetation after working and give some water.

                    The majority, people are usually harvested during the month of <var>May</var> and <var>June</var>. 
                    They can also transplant rice two times a year. But that depends on how the weather is. 
                    If there is lots of rain, they can do that. Therefore, if there is not much rain, they can't transplant two times.
                    </p>

                        Nowadays, people are used to keep <b>rice with its stem</b> 
                        as we can see in the picture above for about a week or so, I would say 
                        it depends on the owner even though they leave it 
                        in the rice field for about a month it won't go off if there is no water in the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>People did that because they have a <b>huge rice field</b> 
                        then they can't do all the work on one day.
                    </p>

                    Most of the time people are usually eating or keeping their first 
                    product but they don't sell it but some of the people don't have money. 
                    Then they have to sell it even though in a low price. They have no choice.
